# Tiktoken

Elixir bindings for OpenAI's [Tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken).

Built on [@zurawiki](https://github.com/zurawiki)'s [tiktoken-rs](https://github.com/zurawiki/tiktoken-rs).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ex_tiktoken` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_tiktoken, "~> 0.1.1"}
  ]
end
```

You will need to have a Rust compiler and Python installed. The libraries the bindings are built on use PyO3 so you may need to set the PyO3 flag before compiling:

```bash
export PYO3_PYTHON=python
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/tiktoken>.
